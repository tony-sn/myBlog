About SCSS Coding

Hi, my name is Tung

I have create a project to mock up Udemy website, to practice my new skill scss that I learn during the course. It's more convenient than css and assisted me in organising my codes. My site can be reached at: https://tony-sn.github.io/udemyMockup/

Udemy landing page would be one of the most challenging project that I have ever done, but it's modern site and up-to-date functions for an online learning website and good for my practicing.

Please feel free to use my codes as your preference, or you can inspect Udemy site, the original source that I am following.

Peace,

Tung Nguyen
