To begin with, I want to talk a bit about my name. I'm Tony Nguyen. It's not my real name, but very akin. Since I cannot register a domain tonynguyen.com, I came up with 7ony. Number 7 represents "S" and "T", my initials middle and first name (what a coincidence). Moreover, my name means a pine tree grown on the mountain, unite to my thrist for learning, a light-bulb moment ðŸ’¡ with "A Forest of Knowledge" has arisen ðŸ˜‚.

I am a full-time dad due to the pandemic, but thanks for that, I have time to enjoy something else in my life, such as spending time with my adorable kid, and learning to become a programmer. To be honest, this is an epiphany moment of my life, because I realise that my love to logical thinking and problem solving can be found in coding and programming, I feel like I have a superpower that can control the computer and it is too cool to ignore.

I spent my youth chasing everything that interested me and never finish any, from opening a business, learning a new language to vocal practicing for becoming a singer, it is likely that when you learn many things, you become an expert of nothing.

This time, I will make an endeavour to become a masterly programmer, a good father and a friendly blogger, as I found out those are more meaningful for my life than what I have experienced before, mostly pointless because of my leave-things-midway habit.
