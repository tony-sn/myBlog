Hello folks and welcome to my page, I am [**7ony Nguyen**](https://7onynguyen.com/) (it's Tony, FYI). I am a self-taught [**programmer**](https://resume.7onynguyen.com/) and a lifetime learner, I love to learn new thing everyday, and I think coding and programming suit me well: it's cool, and you need to spend your whole life to master it. Besides technology, I am also interested in 🎞️ films, 🎵 music, 📓 writing and 💪 gym (now I commit to exercise 5 days/week 😘)

I will update my projects here frequently:

Thanks for surfing my site, anyway :)

Warm regards,

**Tony Nguyen**
